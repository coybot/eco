"""
Minimal arm/takeoff/hover/land example.

This script connects to the flight controller, takes off to a low altitude,
hovers briefly, and lands.

SAFETY: Run this somewhere with plenty of clearance, GPS lock, and a clear
plan to manually take control if anything goes wrong. The SDK clamps
altitude to MIN_ALTITUDE..MAX_ALTITUDE, but it cannot save you from a bad
takeoff site.
